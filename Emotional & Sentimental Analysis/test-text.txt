Hi there! I just wanted to say how delighted I am with your product. It's incredibly well-made and has made my life so much easier. Your customer service team was also very helpful and responsive. Keep up the fantastic work!

Hello, I want to share my disappointment with your product. It didn't meet my expectations at all. The quality was poor, and it broke after just a few uses. I also found your customer service to be unhelpful and slow in responding to my concerns.

I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.
